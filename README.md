#### Europe 

Its an exiting trip of 22 days. I have a good experience where I was enjoyed every moment. Its an adventurace trip with a good city sight seeing views. I visited **reykjavik (IceLand)** last year which is located between the **greenland sea** and the **north atlantic ocean**. The day I look through Northern Lights are one of the most awe-inspiring natural phenomena in the world. **Northern lights** symbolise the magical mysticism of the far **Northern Hemisphoere**. Lastly, throughout this journey, unforgettable moments give us memories, emotions, happiness that last forever.
